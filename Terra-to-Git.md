Can this .yaml file be converted into a .ipynb?

I'll help you convert this Hex notebook YAML file into a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) format. Let me analyze the structure and create the conversion.


Looking at this Hex notebook YAML file, I can see it contains:
- Code cells with Python code
- Text/markdown cells 
- Chart cells (which will need special handling)
- Various metadata and configuration

Let me convert this to a Jupyter notebook format:


```json

Let me create the Jupyter notebook using the proper tool for .ipynb files:


```plaintext


->

# 2.1 Electricity Demand and Generation - NS

The project pulls data from the EIA API and generates charts of electricity generation and demand over a user-specified time period, in a given region, split by fuel types.

Find the API documentation here: 
- https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity/rto/daily-region-data 
- https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/US48/US48
```

```plaintext


->

# Welcome to your first deep dive lab assignment!

# In this lab, you will:
#  0. Get introduced to some terminology around utility-scale electricity demand and generation
#  1. Fetch utility-scale electricity generation and demand timeseries data from the EIA API (using python `requests` package)
#  2. Plot the data to get an understanding of how it varies over time (using Hex's built-in chart widget)
#  3. Do or find something interesting with that data. Exactly what is dependent on your coding level, see below
```

```plaintext


->

# We'll reference these terms later in the notebook, so it's important to understand them now:

# Balancing authority (BA): the organization in charge of ensuring electricity generation meets electricity demand in a given region
#   A BA performs it's own local electricity generation, and then either net imports or net exports energy to other
#   connected BAs, depending on whether local electricity demand is larger or smaller than local electricity generation

# Grid mix: electricity generation breakdown by fuel type (e.g., coal, natural gas, solar, hydro, etc.)
```

```plaintext


->

# You will run the existing notebook, but you'll update it to access data from a different balancing authority (your own local BA if US-based)

# In the next cells, we are going to:
#  1. Import 3rd party libraries
#  2. Define some data access helper functions
#  3. Set some input variables (this is where you'll make some changes!)
#  4. Fetch data
#  5. Plot and explore the data
```

```plaintext


->

# In this cell, we're importing packages that we'll use later in the notebook
# You do not need to make changes to this cell

# 1st party packages (python standard library)

**User**

Convert this .yaml to a .ipynb and store it in TerraDo_Climate_Tech directory folder.

**Cursor**

I'll convert this Hex YAML file to a Jupyter notebook and store it in the TerraDo_Climate_Tech directory. Let me analyze the structure and create the conversion.


Great! I can see the TerraDo_Climate_Tech directory already exists. Now let me create the rooftop solar model notebook:

# 2.2a Rooftop Solar Model - NS

This notebook models a residential rooftop solar (photovoltaic) system. We'll be simulating the electricity generation of our system based on:
- home & roof properties (location, orientation, angle)
- photovoltaic system characteristics  
- historical weather data

Throughout this notebook, we'll model a rooftop solar system, but the modeling would apply to other PV installations as well.

We'll be relying heavily on a 3rd party library, called pvlib, to do the heavy-lifting in fetching weather data and modeling the system

# Photovoltaic (PV) panels: the technical term for what we typcially refer to as "solar panels" 
# Wikipedia: "Photovoltaics is the conversion of light into electricity using semiconducting materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect"
# One other method to harness energy from the sun is "Solar thermal" collection, which concentrates and collects heat from the sun.

# Solar Irradiance: The power per unit area recieved from the Sun (watts per square meter)
#   Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): Solar radiation that comes directly from the sun
#   Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI): Solar radiation that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun, e.g. scattered by clouds
#   Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): Total solar radiation recieved by a horizonal surface - a mathematical combination of the other two:
#     GHI = DNI * cos(solar zenith angle) + DHI

# System Advisor Model (SAM)
# A public data source, curated by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) agency
# It is "a free techno-economic software model that facilitates decision-making for people in the renewable energy industry"
# Relevant to our interests, it contains detailed models of PV panels and inverters
# https://sam.nrel.gov/

# Physical Solar Model (PSM) a.k.a. solar weather
# Another public data source, also from NREL
# It is "satellite-derived measurements of solar radiation and meteorological data".
# In this notebook we'll call this "solar weather" & it includes solar irradiance and weather data for a particular location throughout the year.
# PSM datasets come in historical (pertaining to a particular year) and TMY (Typical Meterological Year, averaged across several years).

# If you're at coding level 0 or 1: Congrats, you made it through the code!

# Now, go back and try tweaking some input variables to play around with the data and look for interesting findings. Ideas:

#   - How significant is the effect of home altitude on the output?
###### When I compare my initial setup at 13m, then 0m, then 313m it seems to have little effect on output (1-10kWh on the year).
###### A google search tells me otherwise, that high altitude can have up to 28% increase in efficiency over ground installs.
###### Perhaps my location in Brooklyn, NY is what makes altitude less of a factor?

#   - What is the impact of orienting the array South-facing vs North-facing?
###### My Brooklyn, NY setup is heavily impacted by facing the panels North instead of South, dropping output to 3285 kWh from 7573 kWh (57% drop).
###### Unless panels were situated near the equator, I would expect flipping the orientation would greatly impact setup ouput in most lattitudes.

#   - How does output of the same PV system compare between two different locations?
###### Switching location from Brooklyn, NY to Hopkins, MN surprisingly increased to annual output to 7704 kWh from 7573 kWh.
###### Minnesota had more volitile output throughout the year, but ultimately output spikes early in the year resulted in greater overall output.
###### I expect the estimated elevation change (to 319m from 13m) is a factor in the occassional increased efficiency seen in Minnesota.

#   - Look up your yearly electricity usage. What capacity system would you need to cover your consumption?
#     (assuming net metering, where you just have to put as much energy in over the course of the year as you take out)
##### With an estimated average of 300 kWh monthly consupmtion in my NY apartment, I would need an annual system capacity of 3600 kWh.

#  - Update the simulation to combine multiple panels with a single inverter. Does this have a significant effect?

1. **Complete Structure**: All cells from the original Hex notebook have been converted
2. **Proper Cell Types**: 
   - Markdown cells for documentation and explanations
   - Python code cells for all the functionality
3. **Chart Visualizations**: Converted the original Hex charts to matplotlib visualizations:
   - Weekly PV generation chart
   - Detailed one-week solar output with solar elevation
4. **API Integration**: Maintained the NREL API integration for solar weather data
5. **Educational Content**: Preserved all the learning goals, terminology, and coding level instructions

### What's Included:

- **Learning goals and terminology** about photovoltaic systems
- **Location and system configuration** inputs
- **Solar weather data fetching** from NREL API
- **PV system simulation** using pvlib
- **Data visualization** with matplotlib charts
- **Analysis and insights** from the original notebook
- **Extension ideas** for advanced users

The notebook is ready to run, though users will need to:
1. Install the required packages (`pvlib`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
2. Set up their NREL API credentials
3. Configure their location and system parameters

The conversion maintains all the educational value and functionality of the original Hex notebook while making it compatible with standard Jupyter environments.

# 2.2b Home Energy Usage Model - NS

This notebook simulates the electricity usage of a home's HVAC system using a "baby energy model" that factors in:
- home envelope characteristics (e.g. dimensions, insulation, window area etc)
- HVAC (heating, venting, air conditioning) system characteristics  
- historical weather data

**Out-of-scope:**
- other major energy consumers, like non-HVAC appliances (water heater, fridge, electronics, etc)
- non-electric energy usage (e.g. using natural gas for central heating)
- splitting heating and cooling into separate systems (we assume there is a single HVAC system that does both heating & cooling)

We'll be involving a 3rd party library, called pvlib, to fetch the historical weather data and model solar irradiance.

# Welcome to your second deep dive lab assignment!

# In this notebook, we're going to simulate the electricity usage of a home's HVAC system
# We're using a "baby energy model" that we're writing from scratch. This is a very simplistic model, so it's only factoring in:
#  - home envelope characteristics (e.g. dimensions, insulation, window area etc)
#  - HVAC (heating, venting, air conditioning) system characteristics
#  - historical weather data

# Out-of-scope
#  - other major energy consumers, like non-HVAC appliances (water heater, fridge, electronics, etc)
#  - non-electric energy usage (e.g. using natural gas for central heating)
#  - splitting heating and cooling into separate systems (we assume there is a single HVAC system that does both heating & cooling)

# We'll be involving a 3rd party library, called pvlib, to fetch the historical weather data and model solar irradiance

# Coding Level 0-1:
# Run the existing notebook, but update it to use different home attributes.

# In the next cells we're going to:
# 1. Import 3rd party libraries
# 2. Constants (& definitions)
# 3. Inputs: Set input variables (this is where you'll make some changes!)
# 4. Fetch public data: historical weather
# 5. Model: simulate the energy usage of our modeled home over a year of historical weather data

# If you're at coding level 0 or 1: Congrats, you made it through the code!

# Now, go back play around with the data and look for interesting findings. Ideas:
#  - There's a lot of interesting things going on in the "Monthly energy balance" chart. Describe what's going on, and why!
#  - For many locations, the "Monthly energy consumption" chart is bimodal (i.e. it has two peaks at different times of the year). Why?
#  - Tweak various inputs to see how they affect the output. How significant is the impact of:
#    - Higher or lower R-value
#    - More or less air leakiness (i.e. higher or lower ach50 values)
#    - Larger or smaller south-facing windows
#    - Different heating & cooling setpoints

# In your Assignment submission on the Terra.do app:
#  1. Link to your copy of this notebook
#  2. Write up a few sentences summarizing your interesting finding (you can share this in slack as well!)

# Coding Level 2-3 - Carry on!

# If you have strong programming experience, use this as a starting point and modify or expand this notebook. Some ideas:
#  - The biggest weakness in this model is how thermal mass is mostly ignored. Integrate a more realistic thermal mass component.
#  - We didn't get hands-on with OpenStudio/EnergyPlus/Resstock because of the difficulty of introducing all the dependencies (they're in Java+Ruby).
#       However, NREL has a bleeding-edge, all-python residential energy modeling project: https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE
#       Install their project (%pip install ochre-nrel), fire it up, and compare it to the toy model.
#  - Calculate your estimated electricy costs (due to HVAC electricity usage)
#    (US average electricity price is around $USD 0.23 per kilowatt-hour, but this can vary widely by location)
#  - Fetch TMY data (Typical Meterological Year, averaged across several years) instead of a data from a specific year
#  - Iterate over one or more attributes (programmatically, with charts to compare the outputs)
#  - Look up your actual electricity usage & compare to these simulated results (you might expect HVAC to be around 30-50% of total usage)
#  - Improve this model - account for more factors!
#  - Combine this notebook with the rooftop solar notebook to model what capacity PV system you would need to operate off-grid, 
#    i.e. meet your energy usage for each hour of the year, not just in total (accounting for high usage but low generation in winter)
```

Perfect! I've successfully converted the **2.2b Home Energy Usage Model - NS.yaml** file into a Jupyter notebook and stored it in the TerraDo_Climate_Tech directory.

## ✅ Conversion Complete

I've converted the **2.2b Home Energy Usage Model - NS.yaml** file into a Jupyter notebook (`home_energy_usage_model.ipynb`) and stored it in the `/Users/nicholassutherland/Desktop/もの/AI/TerraDo_Climate_Tech/` directory.

### Key Features of the Converted Notebook:

1. **Complete Structure**: All cells from the original Hex notebook have been converted
2. **Proper Cell Types**: 
   - Markdown cells for documentation and explanations
   - Python code cells for all the functionality
3. **Chart Visualizations**: Converted the original Hex charts to matplotlib visualizations:
   - Monthly energy balance stacked bar chart
   - Monthly HVAC energy consumption chart
   - Summer week temperature comparison with HVAC mode
   - Winter week temperature comparison with HVAC mode
4. **Energy Modeling**: Complete "baby energy model" implementation with:
   - Home characteristics dataclass
   - HVAC system simulation
   - Energy balance calculations
   - Temperature modeling
5. **Educational Content**: Preserved all the learning goals, terminology, and coding level instructions

### What's Included:

- **Learning goals and terminology** about home energy modeling
- **Home characteristics configuration** with dataclass structure
- **Weather data fetching** from NREL API
- **Energy modeling simulation** with detailed calculations
- **Data visualization** with matplotlib charts
- **Analysis and insights** from the original notebook
- **Extension ideas** for advanced users

The notebook is ready to run, though users will need to:
1. Install the required packages (`pvlib`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
2. Set up their NREL API credentials
3. Configure their home characteristics and location

The conversion maintains all the educational value and functionality of the original Hex notebook while making it compatible with standard Jupyter environments. This completes the conversion of the home energy usage model alongside the previously converted electricity demand and rooftop solar notebooks.

# 2.3 IoT Data Logging - NS

This notebook fetches and displays sensor data collected by our cohort's fleet of IoT devices. The data includes environmental measurements like CO2, temperature, humidity, particulate matter, and battery status from various devices deployed in Las Vegas, NV.

## Data Overview

Our cohort's dataset lives in a Supabase-hosted database table called `iot`. 

Each row in the table represents the data collected by a specific IoT device at a specific moment in time. The columns are:
- **id**: unique (auto-incrementing) identifier for the row
- **created_at**: the timestamp when the data was collected
- **device_id**: the unique identifier of the specific device
- **content**: a dictionary of data (a json blob to be specific), with a key for each type of sensor data collected:
  - `battery_v`: Battery voltage (V)
  - `battery_pct`: Battery percentage (%)
  - `co2_ppm`: CO2 concentration, in parts-per-million (ppm)
  - `humidity_relative`: Relative humidity (%)
  - `temperature_c`: Temperature (degrees C)
  - `pm25 standard`: Particulate matter of size <2.5 micrometers concentration (µg/m³)
  - `pm100 standard`: Particulate matter of size <10.0 micrometers concentration (µg/m³)

The "class" devices are located (with us) just outside Las Vegas, NV:
- `jaimecurtis-co2-temperature`: indoors on my desk
- `jasoncurtis-co2-temp-hum-revTFT`: outdoors in the shade
- `jasoncurtis-co2-airquality`: outdoors in the shade (seems to be getting less consistent CO2 readings)
```

# If you're at coding level 0 or 1: Congrats, you made it through the code!

# Take a look through the data from the various devices and see if you spot any interesting trends or surprising data points.
# Here are some ideas:
#  - Do you notice any trends, e.g. daily fluctuations?
##### (device ID: jaimecurtis-co2-temperature)
##### Temperature peaks just after noon daily, coinciding with a daily low in humidity around that same time
##### Particulate matter, while less consistant, seems to spike between 4pm and 6pm on several days out of a week timespan 
#  - Compare CO2 measurements inside (device ID: jaimecurtis-co2-temperature) vs. outside (device ID: jasoncurtis-co2-airquality). 
##### The inside device is showing CO2 measurements that are half of what the outside device is reading,
#####  which makes sense considering it is insulated from the outdoor environment
#    The average global outdoor CO2 concentration is 400pm - you're probably seeing numbers much higher than this. Why?
##### The ongoing El Niño conditions are contributing to higher Co2 concentrations via disruptions to global carbon cycle and weather patterns. 
#  - Other findings:
##### (device ID: jaimecurtis-co2-temperature)
##### Particulate matter was especially high from afternoon 1/27 until evening 1/29, which is also when humidity was highest 
##### Humidty likely traps/carries particulate matter in the air
##### (device ID: jaimecurtis-co2-temperature)
##### The internal device isn't picking up any particulate matter, so that's good news! ;)
##### The battery % of the device is less stable than the outdoor device, which I'm assuming is because, being on Jason's desk, it's likely
##### competing with other devices (phones, PCs, speakers, etc.) that need charging

# In your Assignment submission on the Terra.do app:
#  1. Link to your copy of this notebook
#  2. Write up a few sentences summarizing your interesting finding (you can share this in slack as well!)
```

# If you have strong programming experience, use this as a starting point and modify or expand this notebook.

# What you choose to do next might depend on whether you have your own device at home

# Here are some ideas:
#  - If you have your own device, consider different locations to place it (inside, outside, next to a plant, etc)
#  - Fetch recorded weather data for a given location and compare to the data collected locally on a device
#  - Combine this data with some other public data
#  - Configure an alert when some piece of sensor data goes above or below a specified level
#    For example, you could create yourself an outdoor air quality warning alert (good for the next cycle of wildfires!)
#    Or, an indoor carbon dioxide concentration alert (e.g. time to open a window)
#  - Bidirectional data flow: Access some data (from our DB or the internet) and use it to control the neopixel LED on your device or display info on screen
#  - Try joining an existing crowd-sourced air sensor network, e.g. Purple Air
#  - Interpret indoor CO2 sensor data as a "room occupancy" indicator

Perfect! I've successfully converted the **2.3 IoT Data Logging - NS.yaml** file into a Jupyter notebook and stored it in the TerraDo_Climate_Tech directory.

## ✅ Conversion Complete

I've converted the **2.3 IoT Data Logging - NS.yaml** file into a Jupyter notebook (`iot_data_logging.ipynb`) and stored it in the `/Users/nicholassutherland/Desktop/もの/AI/TerraDo_Climate_Tech/` directory.

### Key Features of the Converted Notebook:

1. **Complete Structure**: All cells from the original Hex notebook have been converted
2. **Proper Cell Types**: 
   - Markdown cells for documentation and explanations
   - Python code cells for all the functionality
3. **Database Integration**: Converted SQL queries to Python database connections:
   - Supabase REST API integration
   - Alternative SQL query methods
   - Error handling for connection issues
4. **Chart Visualizations**: Converted the original Hex charts to matplotlib visualizations:
   - CO2 levels chart
   - Temperature chart
   - Relative humidity chart
   - Particulate matter chart (PM2.5 and PM10.0)
   - Battery voltage and percentage chart
5. **Educational Content**: Preserved all the learning goals, terminology, and coding level instructions

### What's Included:

- **Learning goals and data overview** about IoT sensor data
- **Database connection setup** for Supabase integration
- **Device selection and time range configuration**
- **Data fetching and processing** with hourly aggregation
- **Data visualization** with matplotlib charts for all sensor types
- **Analysis and insights** from the original notebook
- **Extension ideas** for advanced users

### Key Adaptations Made:

1. **SQL to Python**: Converted SQL queries to Python functions using Supabase REST API
2. **Input Widgets**: Replaced Hex input widgets with simple Python variables
3. **Database Connection**: Added comprehensive error handling and connection setup
4. **Chart Conversion**: All interactive Hex charts converted to static matplotlib visualizations
5. **Data Processing**: Maintained the hourly aggregation and median calculations

The notebook is ready to run, though users will need to:
1. Install the required packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `requests`, `sqlalchemy`)
2. Set up their Supabase credentials
3. Configure their device selection and time ranges

This completes the conversion of all three climate tech notebooks:
- ✅ Electricity Demand and Generation
- ✅ Rooftop Solar Model  
- ✅ Home Energy Usage Model
- ✅ IoT Data Logging

All notebooks are now available in the TerraDo_Climate_Tech directory and ready for use in standard Jupyter environments!
